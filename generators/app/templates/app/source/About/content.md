So about crust... what comes to mind?

***

### Flexible

You can use [markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) or raw HTML as content.

***

### Decentralized data

Because of the fact that you can use markdown as your data source, you don't bind your data to use in Crust only. You could also easily pull out the markdown files and publish them as a gitbook or whatever you'd like.

***

### Lightweight

Seeing as there's no need for a database or a major server setup, you're fairly easy ready to get going.

***

### Performant

If you use the [Yeoman generator](https://github.com/teltploek/generator-crust) to get started, you will get all the performance benefits build in. We make use of the critical package to inline above the fold CSS, and other cool stuff to take your page speed score as high as possible for the finished product.

***

### Yaml for configuraiton

A fairly easy configuration setup is done through simple key value pairs in close-by yaml files.

***

### Ease of deploy

By doing a static de-coupled HTML product you're able to deploy it anywhere. There's no need for databases or fancy and expensive servers. Just put the files out there and you're ready to present your content to the world.
